# League Of Nations Rewritten

## :wrench: Setup

To setup this project, you need to first install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You then need to write a ``.env`` file that contains the following variables:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

the database url is the connection to the database for example: ``sqlite:///db.sqlite3``
